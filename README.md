# photo_dump
a VBA script for (old) outlook to dump pictures from emails, inline or attached

The major reasons to use photo_dump:
1) It's annoying to click every attachment when there's more than a few
2) Outlook is always trying to open its preview pane and this script avoids it
3) Inline photos are the devil's own creation and a huge annoyance to dump - this script solves it
